                 <h2>LSTM FOR PREDICTING ENERGY CONSUMPTION</h2>
                 <div>In a rapidly evolving energy paradigm, our team united with a singular mission: to harness deep learning for pinpoint energy consumption forecasting over a pivotal 100-day span. Using Python, we championed the LSTM model, renowned for time-series mastery. Real-world energy trends, depicted in red, were measured against our blue-hued LSTM predictions from May to mid-June 2018. Initial predictions posed challenges, and the intricate energy data landscape tested our model's mettle. However, meticulous LSTM calibration led to a rise in accuracy from 93% to 99%. Our collaborative journey and LSTM's prowess culminated in an impressive 96.6% overall accuracy, underscoring the fusion of teamwork and AI in transforming the energy sector's future.
